		<h2>Tanner Krewson - CS 315 Project Proposal</h2>
		<p>
			For this semester, I will be building a website dedicated to
			comparing dogs and cats. It will list the pros and cons of each
			animal, and will include an abundance of pictures. It will also
			have a list of the most popular breeds. I will also include
			resources that will help potenitial owners determine whether a dog
			or a cat would be right for them. Although this is all I have
			thought of thus far, I'm sure more ideas will come to me as I
			create the site. Once completed, the website will be the most
			comprehenisive dog-and-cat comparison resource on the
			world-wide-web.
		</p>
		<p>
			I think the dog and cat idea will lend itself well to each
			milestone. For example, I could use CSS to organize the content and
			make it easier for the user to understand. Using PHP, I could
			create a form that allows users to take a quiz to test their dog
			and cat knowlege, or allow them to submit their comments on whether
			they prefer dogs or cats. These features could be further enhanced
			with JavaScript and a MySQL database.
		</p>
		<p>
			All in all, I am excited to get started working on a dog and cat
			comparison website. It will be a lot of fun to see what different
			features I can come up with to add, because although I've thought
			of a few so far, I'm sure I will come up with more ideas as I go
			along.
