				<h2>Top 5 Cat Breeds</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<h3>Persian Cat</h3>
						<blockquote>
							The Persian is the glamor puss of the cat world. His beautiful, flowing coat, sweet face and calm personality have combined to make him the most popular cat breed. He is high maintenance and he has some health issues, but for many his looks and personality overcome those drawbacks.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Maine Coon</h3>
						<blockquote>
							The official state cat of Maine is -- you guessed it -- the Maine Coon. This plus-size cat, adorned with a beautiful neck ruff, dainty britches, tufted feet that resemble snowshoes and a big, bushy tail that he can wrap around himself when he naps is likely the oldest cat breed native to America.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Siamese Cat</h3>
						<blockquote>
							One of the best-known cat breeds, the Siamese is curious, smart, vocal and demanding. If you want a cat who will converse with you all day long, the Siamese may be your perfect match. The Siamese weighs six to 10 pounds and has a distinctive coat with dark “points” on a light background.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Ragdoll</h3>
						<blockquote>
							His floppy, relaxed good nature gives the Ragdoll his name. He is a big, gentle cat with striking blue eyes who can get along with everyone, including other animals, traits that make him adaptable to almost any home. His semi-longhaired coat, which comes in a variety of patterns and colors, is easy to groom.
						</blockquote>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>British Shorthair</h3>
						<blockquote>
							The British Shorthair is solid and muscular with an easygoing personality. As befits his British heritage, he is slightly reserved, but once he gets to know someone he’s quite affectionate. His short, dense coat comes in many colors and patterns and should be brushed two or three times a week to remove dead hair.
