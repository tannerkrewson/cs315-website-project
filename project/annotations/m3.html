		<h2>Tanner Krewson - CS 315 Project Milestone 2 Annotation</h2>
		<p>
			For milestone 2, I added three new features to the site with
			JavaScript:
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you hover your mouse over the dog and cat on the home
					page, they will flip places.
					<a href="../flip.js">Source Code</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					I added a game of fetch to the bottom of the homepage
				</li>
				<li>
					I made a new page that allows the user to enter a tip they
					have for new pet owners. It sanitizes all text inputs with
					the "htmlspecialchars" function to prevent HTML injection.
					It only displays the comment the user sent, and does not
					save anything yet. I will save comments using MySQL in the
					future.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the source files are a little harder to find, so I've
			included links below:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="../includes/header.phps">../includes/header.phps</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../includes/footer.phps">../includes/footer.phps</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../quiz/index.phps">../quiz/index.phps</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../tips/index.phps">../tips/index.phps</a>

			</ul>
