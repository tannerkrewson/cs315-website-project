		<h2>Tanner Krewson - CS 315 Project Milestone 4 Annotation</h2>
		<p>
			For milestone 4, I added the ability for users to submit and view
			tips about owning pets. This feature is implemented using HTML
			forms and PHP that connects to MySQL via the PDO interface.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the links to the page:<br>
			<a href="../tips/">The page itself</a><br>
			<a href="../tips/index.phps">The source code of the index page</a><br>
			<a href="../tips/tip-list.phps">The source code of just the tips list</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			I have also made the following observations regarding the security
			of my site as a whole:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The only part of the site that is open to security issues
					is the tips page, as it allows for user input.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the user submits the Tips form, the first thing that
					the PHP does is run each field through the htmlspecialchars
					function. This ensures that all characters that could
					potentially be used for HTML injection are escaped.
				</li>
				<li>
					To make sure that an invalid email is not entered by the
					user on accident (or maliciously), the PHP uses regular
					expressions to verify that the email address is at the very
					least in the proper format. There is no check to make sure
					that the email is reachable.
				</li>
				<li>
					If this website was in a production environment, I would
					want to take the database password out of the publically
					accessible PHP source code so that someone could not hack
					it.
				</li>
				<li>
					The PHP then uses the PDO interface's prepare function to
					protect against SQL injections.
				</li>
				<li>
					The PHP code for displaying the contents of the database
					displays all rows unconditionally, and does not make any
					checks on the contents. So, if some unescaped HTML were to
					somehow make it into the database, it would be displayed.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is also no check on the length of the fields. So,
					someone could spam the field with very long text and flood
					the tips page.
				</li>
				<li>
					The tips page also does not prevent someone from using a
					botnet to submit extremely quickly. In this way, they could
					also flood the tips page.  I would definitely want to fix
					these last few points if the page were to released to the
					world, but do not necessarily pose an immediate security
					risk as it stands.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			Below you can find the table definition for the Tips page:<br>
			<code>
				CREATE TABLE `project` (<br>
				  `id` int(10) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,<br>
				  `name` text NOT NULL,<br>
				  `email` text NOT NULL,<br>
				  `date` datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,<br>
				  `tip` text NOT NULL<br>
				) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;<br>
			</code>
