		<h2>Tanner Krewson - CS 315 Project Milestone 2 Annotation</h2>
		<p>
			For milestone 2, I added three new features to the site:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The header with the navigation bar, and the footer with my
					name are "included" in each subpage. The relative links
					for each navigation bar button is also automatically
					generated depending on which directory the page you are
					viewing is in. This prevents having to copy lots of HTML to
					make a new page, and it makes it trivial to add a new link
					to the navigation bar without having to go back through
					each page to change it.
				</li>
				<li>
					I used PHP to score the quiz and determine if the user
					would like a cat or dog more.
				</li>
				<li>
					I made a new page that allows the user to enter a tip they
					have for new pet owners. It sanitizes all text inputs with
					the "htmlspecialchars" function to prevent HTML injection.
					It only displays the comment the user sent, and does not
					save anything yet. I will save comments using MySQL in the
					future.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the source files are a little harder to find, so I've
			included links below:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="../includes/header.phps">../includes/header.phps</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../includes/footer.phps">../includes/footer.phps</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="../quiz/index.phps">../quiz/index.phps</a>
